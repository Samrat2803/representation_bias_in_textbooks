        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Textbooks play a crucial role in shaping the knowledge and understanding of students. However, it is widely acknowledged that textbooks can also perpetuate biases and inaccuracies. Our research project aims to analyze the extent to which representation bias exists in our textbooks and its implications for student learning and understanding.</p>

      <section id="methodology">
        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>We analyzed a sample of widely used textbooks across multiple subjects and evaluated them for representation bias. Our methodology was designed to be systematic and comprehensive, with a focus on identifying and documenting instances of bias and underrepresented groups.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="findings">
        <h2>Findings</h2>
        <p>The results of our analysis showed that representation bias is indeed present in our textbooks, with certain groups being underrepresented or misrepresented. Our findings also indicate that this has significant implications for student learning and understanding.</p>
      </section>
      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Our research highlights the need for greater attention to representation bias in our textbooks and its impact on student learning and understanding. We hope that our findings will help to bring about meaningful change and more equitable representation in the materials used in our classrooms.</p>
